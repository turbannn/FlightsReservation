# Reservation Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete flight reservation system with seat selection, passenger information collection, and confirmation pages.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Start Reservation Button (flights.js)
- Added "Start Reservation" button to each flight card
- Button stores flight ID in sessionStorage and redirects to seats.html
- Updated flight card labels to English

### 2. Seat Selection Page (seats.html + seats.js)
**Features:**
- Fetches flight details using GetFlight endpoint (FlightAdminReadDto)
- Displays flight information (number, route, times, price)
- Shows all available seats (filters locked seats by checking Lock date)
- Multiple seat selection with checkboxes
- Dynamic button text showing selected seat count
- Validates at least one seat is selected
- Calls BeginReservation endpoint with selected seat IDs
- Redirects to passengers.html on success

**Data Flow:**
```
sessionStorage: selectedFlightId → API: GetFlight → Display seats
User selects seats → API: BeginReservation → sessionStorage: lockedSeatIds, reservationFlightId
```

### 3. Passenger Information Page (passengers.html + passengers.js)
**Features:**
- Dynamically generates passenger forms based on number of selected seats
- Each form collects:
  - FirstName
  - LastName
  - PassportNumber
  - PhoneNumber
  - Email
  - SeatId (automatically assigned)
- Validates all required fields
- Creates ReservationCreateDto with proper structure
- Calls CommitReservation endpoint
- Redirects to confirmation.html on success

**DTO Structure (matches C# DTOs):**
```javascript
{
  FlightId: "guid",
  Passengers: [
    {
      FirstName: "string",
      LastName: "string",
      PassportNumber: "string",
      PhoneNumber: "string",
      Email: "string",
      SeatId: "guid"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Confirmation Page (confirmation.html + confirmation.js)
**Features:**
- Displays success message with checkmark icon
- Shows reservation details (ID, timestamp, status)
- Lists all passengers with their information
- Provides navigation buttons to profile or new search
- Cleans up sessionStorage after display

### 5. Configuration Updates (config.js)
Added new API endpoints:
- `getFlightById: '/Flights/GetFlight'`
- `beginReservation: '/Reservations/BeginReservation'`
- `commitReservation: '/Reservations/CommitReservation'`

### 6. Styling (style.css)
Added comprehensive styles for:
- Flight action buttons
- Seat grid layout with checkbox styling
- Passenger form cards
- Confirmation page with success icon
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Complete Flow

1. **Search Flights** → User searches for flights on index.html
2. **View Results** → Results displayed on flights.html with "Start Reservation" button
3. **Select Seats** → User clicks button → seats.html loads flight details → user selects seats
4. **Lock Seats** → User clicks "Begin Reservation" → API locks seats → redirect to passengers.html
5. **Enter Passenger Info** → User fills forms for each seat → clicks "Complete Reservation"
6. **Commit Reservation** → API creates reservation → redirect to confirmation.html
7. **View Confirmation** → Success message and details displayed

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used:
1. **GET** `/Flights/GetFlight?id={guid}` - Get flight with seats (FlightAdminReadDto)
2. **POST** `/Reservations/BeginReservation` - Lock seats (body: array of seat GUIDs)
3. **POST** `/Reservations/CommitReservation` - Create reservation (body: ReservationCreateDto)

### Authentication:
All requests use `credentials: 'include'` for JWT cookie authentication.

### Error Handling:
- Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Validation before API calls
- Proper HTTP status code handling

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `Front/seats.html` - Seat selection page
- `Front/js/seats.js` - Seat selection logic
- `Front/passengers.html` - Passenger info page
- `Front/js/passengers.js` - Passenger form handling
- `Front/confirmation.html` - Confirmation page
- `Front/js/confirmation.js` - Confirmation display

### Modified:
- `Front/js/flights.js` - Added Start Reservation button and function
- `Front/js/config.js` - Added new API endpoints
- `Front/css/style.css` - Added styling for new pages

## Field Naming Convention
All JavaScript objects use **PascalCase** to match C# DTOs:
- `FirstName`, `LastName`, `PassportNumber`, `PhoneNumber`, `Email`
- `FlightId`, `SeatId`
- `DepartureCity`, `ArrivalCity`, `DepartureDate`, `ReturnDate`

## Session Storage Usage
- `selectedFlightId` - Flight chosen for reservation
- `lockedSeatIds` - Array of seat GUIDs locked for reservation
- `reservationFlightId` - Flight ID for CommitReservation
- `reservationResult` - API response for confirmation page
- `reservationPassengers` - Passenger data for confirmation display

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search for flights
- [ ] Click "Start Reservation" button
- [ ] Verify flight details load correctly
- [ ] Select multiple seats
- [ ] Verify button updates with seat count
- [ ] Click "Begin Reservation"
- [ ] Verify passenger forms generate correctly
- [ ] Fill in all passenger information
- [ ] Click "Complete Reservation"
- [ ] Verify confirmation page displays
- [ ] Check profile page for new reservation

## Notes
- Seat availability is determined by comparing Lock date with current time
- Empty Lock dates (default DateTime) are considered available
- All DTO field names match backend exactly (PascalCase)
- Proper error logging implemented throughout
- Mobile-responsive design included
